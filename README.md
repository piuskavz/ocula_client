# ocula_client
This is a repository for code used on android smartphones for the purposes of:
  - capturing image frames from an android smartphone camera
  - displaying the frames one at a time at a given frame rate
  - passing the images to a server via sockets and receiving back corresponding annotation files
  - overlaying the annotations over the initial image

This work was done for the Makerere AI lab Ocula project in which smartphones were attached to existing compound microscopes, and a convolutional neural network used to analyse the microscope slides images captured by the smartphones. Further details on the project can be found at http://air.ug/microscopy/
